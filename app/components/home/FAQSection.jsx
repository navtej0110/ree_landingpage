  {
    question: "WHY USE YOU IF WE ALREADY HAVE TOOLS?",
    answer: "Most tools solve one problem. We connect everything — your POS, webstore, inventory, and team workflows — into one automated system. We also handle the gaps your current tools leave behind.",
  },
  {
    question: "IS THIS ONLY FOR SECONDHAND STORES?",
    answer: "No. We work with fashion retail, e-commerce, and any product-based business. Secondhand is our roots, but our systems work across all retail formats.",
  },
  {
    question: "WHAT DOES GUARANTEE MEAN?",
    answer: "We agree on a target upfront — for example, 60 hours saved per month. We measure it. If we don't hit it, we keep working until we do. No extra charge.",
  },
  {
    question: "HOW FAST DO WE SEE RESULTS?",
    answer: "Most clients see measurable time savings within the first two weeks of deployment. Full impact is typically visible within 30–60 days.",
  },
  {
    question: "CAN WE START SMALL?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer a standalone audit with no commitment to continue. Many clients start with one automation and expand from there.",
  },
  {
    question: "WHAT IF MY TEAM ISN'T TECHNICAL?",
    answer: "That's exactly who we build for. We handle all implementation and provide hands-on training. Your team just uses the result.",
  },
  {
    question: "WHAT DOES THE DAY RATE INCLUDE?",
    answer: "Everything: discovery, build, testing, deployment, and documentation. No hidden costs. You know the scope and price before we start.",
  },
